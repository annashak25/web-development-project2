        <p>Hello, my name is Anna and I'm a sophmore at KSU majoring in Information Technology. I have 4 younger brothers aged 14, 12, 10, and 8. I love spending time with them and we always have so much fun! I am also involved in the Jewish community and have been a 1st Grade Sunday School Teacher for the past 2 years. Some of my hobbies are reading, playing piano, singing, and playing video games with my friends and brothers.</p>
